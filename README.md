# iCoder Django Project

This blog has the functionality working right now of displaying blog posts that you post from Admin Panel in /blog

Login, Signup and Contact us also working and anything submitted through that will be displayed in the admin panel

I haven't given much importance to frontend but added basic layouts so that you can just clone and start working on your blog right away

The email, passwords etc. data of the registered users is automatically handled by django so you don't have to worry about the the security of data of users

Currently, working on the comments model, you can post comment in any post, it will show in admin panel but won't show below the post, I'll keep updating the project daily

Feedback and Suggestions are always welcome
